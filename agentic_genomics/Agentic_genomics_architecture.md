# Agent Foundation Structure
Your agents should extend the LlmAgent class, which provides the core reasoning capabilities through LLM integration llm_agent.py:117-118 . Each agent can be configured with specific tools, instructions, and reasoning capabilities llm_agent.py:138-139 .

# Individual Agent Implementation
## PipelineScoutAgent
Create this as an LlmAgent with custom tools for pipeline discovery. You'll need to implement custom tools that inherit from BaseTool base_tool.py:32-33 for your list_nf_core_pipelines and get_pipeline_schema functionality. Tools can process LLM requests and run asynchronously base_tool.py:83-84 .

## ConfiguratorAgent, BlueprintArchitectAgent & DeploymentEngineerAgent
These follow the same pattern - each as an LlmAgent with specialized tools for their respective functions (config generation, blueprint creation, deployment execution).

## Sequential Workflow Implementation
For your DeploymentWorkflow, use the SequentialAgent which runs sub-agents in sequence sequential_agent.py:29-30 . The sequential agent executes each sub-agent in order sequential_agent.py:36-38 .

## Human-in-the-Loop Integration
The ADK provides a get_user_choice_tool for human interaction get_user_choice_tool.py:21-24 . This tool can present options to users and wait for their selection. You can create similar custom tools for parameter validation and approval workflows.

## Agent Transfer and Orchestration
Your OrchestratorAgent can use the built-in agent transfer mechanism transfer_to_agent_tool.py:18-19 to delegate control between agents. The transfer function hands off control to another agent based on agent names transfer_to_agent_tool.py:27 .

## Agent Hierarchy Structure
Use the agent parent-child relationship system where agents can have sub-agents base_agent.py:92-93 . Your OrchestratorAgent can be the root with discovery, configuration, and deployment agents as children or siblings.

## Custom Tool Development
For your bioinformatics-specific tools (nf-core integration, Nextflow config generation, Terraform operations), create custom tools by:

## Inheriting from BaseTool
Implementing _get_declaration() for the function schema
Implementing run_async() for the actual tool execution base_tool.py:64-81
Event-Driven Communication
Agents communicate through an event system where each agent generates events during execution base_agent.py:125-137 . This allows for real-time monitoring and coordination between agents.

## Configuration and Flexibility
Each LlmAgent supports extensive configuration including custom instructions, tool sets, model selection, and callback functions for preprocessing and postprocessing llm_agent.py:120-149 .

## Notes:

The ADK provides a robust foundation for multi-agent systems with built-in LLM integration, tool management, and agent orchestration
The sequential agent pattern perfectly matches your deployment workflow requirements
Human-in-the-loop capabilities are built-in and can be extended for complex parameter validation scenarios
The agent transfer mechanism enables flexible control flow between specialized agents
Custom tools can integrate with any external APIs or services (nf-core, Nextflow, Terraform, etc.)

# Sample Agent Implementation
Looking at the existing agent examples agent.py:117-146 , here's how your root orchestrator agent might look:

## agent.py  
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent  
from google.adk.tools import get_user_choice  
from agents.pipeline_scout import PipelineScoutAgent  
from tools.deployment_workflow import DeploymentWorkflowTool  
  
root_agent = LlmAgent(  
    name="orchestrator_agent",  
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",  
    description="Orchestrates bioinformatics pipeline deployment",  
    instruction="""  
    You are a bioinformatics pipeline orchestrator. You help users:  
    1. Discover and understand nf-core pipelines  
    2. Configure pipeline parameters with human approval  
    3. Deploy pipelines to cloud infrastructure  
      
    Always ask for user confirmation before proceeding with deployment steps.  
    """,  
    tools=[  
        # Pipeline discovery tools  
        # Human-in-the-loop tools  
        get_user_choice,  
        # Workflow execution tool  
        DeploymentWorkflowTool(),  
    ],  
    sub_agents=[  
        PipelineScoutAgent(),  
    ]  
)

## Development and Testing
Once you've created the scaffolding, you can test your agents using the ADK's development tools:

Interactive CLI testing: cli_tools_click.py:183-261

adk run bioinformatics_pipeline_manager
Web interface development: cli_tools_click.py:549-627

adk web bioinformatics_pipeline_manager
Custom Tools Structure
For your bioinformatics-specific tools, create classes that inherit from BaseTool and implement the required methods. The ADK's tool system supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns.

## Notes:

The adk create command sets up the basic structure with proper imports and a simple agent template
You can extend this structure to accommodate your multi-agent architecture
The ADK's agent loader supports both module-based and package-based agent structures, giving you flexibility in organization
Use the development web interface for testing human-in-the-loop interactions before deployment
